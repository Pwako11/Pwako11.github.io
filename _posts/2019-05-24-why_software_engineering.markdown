Computers have always fascinated me. The ability of an inanimate object to capture, sort, store and share information at volume and speeds far greater than the human brain, the dawn of the digital revolution and the capabilities yet to be realized in computing drove me to seek a career in this field. 

At an early age, I wanted to learn all I could about computers. How to build them, how they worked and how they communicated with each other.  I bought all kind of computers; desktops, laptops, smartphones, and servers. I took them apart and put them back together. I sought to find out how they worked at the most basic level. 

Once comfortable with fixing the hardware, I begun learning how computers communicate with each other. I learned about, Local Area Networks, Wide Area Networks, wired and wireless communications. The equipment that enables networking (routers and switches) and the underlying protocols that make this type of communication possible. 

With more people than every having access to the internet via computer or smart phone, next next logical step was to understand how to program computers and get them to do what I want them to do. I had a desire to manipulate how computers communicate, how they think (compute) and how they return this information back to the user. As computer hardware continues at a steady pace, software advancements have been advancing at an exponential pace. The limitless possibility to create new functions and features that enable people to do more with computers through software drove me to pursue engineering. 

Having had a little experience in programing, I understood the steep learning curve required to become a software engineer. I researched a number of coding schools and settled on Flatiron based on the curriculum and pace at which the courses were instructed.  Coding is essentially learning a new language, to be successful I will need lots of practice and repetition to get me to proficiency. Challenge accepted.
